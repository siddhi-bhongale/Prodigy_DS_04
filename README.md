Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 4: Sentiment Analysis & Visualization
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, Task 4 focused on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics and brands. I used a Twitter sentiment analysis dataset sourced from Kaggle to perform this task.

Overview
I conducted a sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. This helped uncover trends in how entities such as companies or public figures are perceived on social media platforms. The insights were visualized to provide a clearer understanding of sentiment distribution and common keywords associated with each sentiment.
